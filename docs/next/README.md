**agent multiplexer that lives in your terminal.**

workspaces, tabs, panes. mouse-native: click, drag, split. every agent at a glance: blocked, working, done. detach and reattach, agents keep running. no gui app, no electron, no mac-only native wrapper. you see the agent's own terminal, not someone's interpretation of it.

---

## install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gmux.dev/install.sh | sh
```

or install with homebrew:

```bash
brew install gmux
```

or install with mise:

```bash
mise use -g gmux
```

or download the binary from [releases](https://github.com/ogulcancelik/gmux/releases). requires linux or macos.

## quick start

Start Gmux in the directory where the work lives:

```bash
gmux
```

Gmux starts or attaches to one background session server. Use the root pane like a normal shell. Press `ctrl+b`, then `%` or `"` to split panes, and `ctrl+b`, then `c` to create a tab.

Press `ctrl+b d` to detach the client. The server and pane processes keep running. Open another terminal and run `gmux` again to reattach.

## core concepts

**Server and client.** By default, `gmux` attaches to a background server. Detaching closes only the client. `gmux kill-session` stops the default server and kills its panes. Named sessions are separate server namespaces: use `gmux new -s work`, `gmux attach -t work`, `gmux kill-session -t work`, and `gmux ls` when you want fully separate runtime state.

**Sessions, tabs, panes.** A session owns tabs, and tabs group panes. Panes are real terminal processes, not rewritten agent views.

**Copy.** Gmux copies pane text, not the sidebar. Drag-select inside a pane, double-click a word or token, or press `prefix+[` for keyboard copy mode. In copy mode, move with `h/j/k/l`, `w/b/e`, and `{`/`}`, start selection with `v` or Space, copy with `y` or Enter, and leave with `q` or Esc. In PuTTY and some SSH terminals, hold `Shift` while dragging to use the terminal's own selection, and `Shift` + right click to paste.

**Update and restore.** `gmux update` installs a new binary, but a running server keeps using the old process until it is stopped or handed off. Stop the old server to use the new version. Stopping exits pane processes. Run `gmux kill-session`, then run `gmux` again for the default session. For a named session, run `gmux kill-session -t <name>`, then run `gmux attach -t <name>` again. `gmux update --handoff` is experimental and tries to move live panes, including foreground processes such as dev servers, from the old server to the new one. With current official integrations installed, supported agent panes can restart from their native agent sessions after a server restart or update.

**Keybindings.** Gmux uses explicit keybinding strings. `prefix+n` means press the configured prefix, then `n`. `ctrl+alt+n`, `cmd+k`, `alt+1`, and function-key chords are direct terminal-mode shortcuts and do not need the prefix. Plain direct printable keys such as `n` steal normal typing, so use `prefix+n` unless you intentionally want a modifier-gated direct binding.

**Agent awareness.** The sidebar shows blocked, working, done, and idle states. Detection works with process names and terminal output by default. Official integrations can add native session identity for restore, semantic state reports, or both.

## update

Gmux notifies you when a new version is available. Run manually:

```bash
gmux update
```

`gmux update` is for installs managed by Gmux's own installer. Homebrew, mise, and Nix installs update through `brew upgrade gmux`, `mise upgrade gmux`, or your Nix workflow, then use the same stop-and-run-again flow if a session is still running the old server. Direct installs can opt into development preview builds with `gmux channel set preview` and return to stable with `gmux channel set stable`. See [install docs](https://gmux.dev/docs/install/) and [session state docs](https://gmux.dev/docs/session-state/) for the full update, restart, restore, and handoff matrix.

Gmux uses the stable update channel by default. To test preview builds from `master` before the next stable release:

```bash
gmux channel set preview
```

To return to stable:

```bash
gmux channel set stable
```

For direct installs, changing channels also checks that channel and installs its latest binary. If that update fails, run `gmux update` to retry from the configured channel.

Preview is only for direct installs managed by Gmux's updater. Homebrew, mise, and Nix stay on stable and update through their package managers.

## how it compares

|                          | tmux | gui managers | gmux |
|--------------------------|------|--------------|-------|
| persistent sessions       | ✓    | —            | ✓     |
| detach / reattach        | ✓    | —            | ✓     |
| panes, tabs, workspaces  | ✓    | ✓            | ✓     |
| agent awareness          | —    | ✓            | ✓     |
| lives in your terminal   | ✓    | —            | ✓     |
| real terminal views      | ✓    | —            | ✓     |
| mouse-native            | —    | ✓            | ✓     |
| lightweight binary       | ✓    | —            | ✓     |
| agents can orchestrate   | ?    | ?            | ✓     |

tmux gives you persistence and panes, but it was built before agents existed. gui managers show agent state, but they make you leave your terminal and use their wrapped view. gmux is persistence and awareness in one tool that stays out of your way.

## remote and attach

Gmux works over normal SSH. Run it on the remote host, detach, and reattach later:

```
ssh you@yourserver
gmux
```

You can also attach from your local terminal without opening a shell first:

```bash
gmux --remote workbox
gmux --remote ssh://you@yourserver:2222
```

Remote attach adds fallback SSH keepalives by default while preserving your own SSH config. Set `[remote].manage_ssh_config = false` to use plain `ssh`.

Direct attach connects your current terminal to one server-owned terminal:

```bash
gmux agent attach <target>
gmux terminal attach <terminal_id>
```

See [persistence and remote docs](https://gmux.dev/docs/persistence-remote/) for remote keybinding, named-session, and handoff details.

## agent awareness

the sidebar shows which agents are blocked, working, or done. workspaces roll up to their most urgent state so you can scan the full list at a glance.

states:

- 🔴 **blocked** — agent needs input or approval
- 🟡 **working** — agent is actively running
- 🔵 **done** — work finished, you have not looked at it yet
- 🟢 **idle** — done and seen

detection works by reading foreground process and terminal output. zero config, no hooks required. official claude code, codex, droid, and opencode integrations provide session restore identity; pi, omp, github copilot cli, kimi code cli, hermes, qodercli, and custom socket integrations can report their own state.

## lives in your terminal

not a gui window, not a web dashboard, not electron. gmux runs inside whatever terminal you already use. single rust binary, no dependencies. works inside tmux as the outer terminal environment.

## what you get

- **workspaces** — organized around git repos or folder names, each with its own tabs and panes
- **tabs** — first-class in the socket api and cli
- **copy-friendly** — drag-select pane text, double-click tokens, or use keyboard copy mode with `prefix+[`, `h/j/k/l`, `{`/`}`, `v`, and `y`
- **notifications** — sounds and toasts for background events; tab-aware suppression
- **18 built-in themes** — catppuccin, terminal, tokyo night, gruvbox, one, solarized, kanagawa, rosé pine, vesper, and light variants for the main palettes
- **session persistence** — pane processes survive client detach; sessions restore panes after full restart, with opt-in recent screen history

## agents can use gmux too

The local Unix socket lets agents create workspaces, split panes, spawn helpers, read output, and wait for state changes. Start with the [socket API docs](https://gmux.dev/docs/socket-api/) and [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md).

## supported agents

automatic detection works out of the box. process name matching plus terminal output heuristics.

| agent | idle / done | working | blocked |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------|

detected but not fully tested: gemini cli, cline.

for agents outside the built-in list, gmux still works as a terminal multiplexer with workspaces, panes, and tiling. custom integrations can report agent labels over the socket api. see the [socket api docs](https://gmux.dev/docs/socket-api/).

### direct integrations

official integrations have two roles. claude code, codex, droid, and opencode report session identity for native restore, while their state still comes from screen detection. pi, github copilot cli, and hermes report both semantic state and session identity. omp, kimi code cli, and qodercli report semantic state without native session restore. install with:

```bash
gmux integration install pi
gmux integration install omp
gmux integration install claude
gmux integration install codex
gmux integration install copilot
gmux integration install droid
gmux integration install kimi
gmux integration install opencode
gmux integration install hermes
gmux integration install qodercli
```

see the [integrations docs](https://gmux.dev/docs/integrations/) for setup details.

## keybindings

Press `ctrl+b` to enter prefix mode. Default actions are prefix-first and tmux-like:

| key | action |
|-----|--------|
| `prefix+c` | new tab |
| `prefix+n` / `prefix+p` | next / previous tab |
| `prefix+1..9` | switch tab |
| `prefix+w` | workspace navigation |
| `prefix+g` | session navigator |
| `prefix+shift+n` | new workspace |
| `prefix+shift+g` | new worktree |
| `prefix+shift+w` | rename workspace |
| `prefix+shift+d` | close workspace |
| `prefix+h/j/k/l` | focus pane |
| `prefix+%` / `prefix+"` | split pane |
| `prefix+x` | close pane |
| `prefix+b` | toggle sidebar |
| `prefix+z` | zoom pane |
| `prefix+r` | resize mode |
| `prefix+d` | detach |

Mouse is supported throughout. Resize mode uses `h`/`l` for width, `j`/`k` for height, and `esc` to exit. Full syntax, optional actions, indexed bindings, and custom command bindings live in the [configuration docs](https://gmux.dev/docs/configuration/).

## configuration

config file: `~/.config/gmux/config.toml`

```bash
gmux --default-config   # print full default config
```

In-app settings cover theme, sound, and toast preferences. Gmux writes logs under `~/.config/gmux/`; in persistent session mode, `gmux-client.log` and `gmux-server.log` are usually the useful files. Full configuration and logging details live in the [configuration docs](https://gmux.dev/docs/configuration/).
